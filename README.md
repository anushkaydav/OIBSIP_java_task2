# OIBSIP_java_task2
Java-based simulation of an ATM machine that supports basic banking operations like checking balance, withdrawing, depositing, and exiting. Built as part of OIBSIP Internship Java Development Task 2.
# 👩‍💻 Project Objective:
The goal of this project is to simulate a basic ATM interface in Java. It allows users to perform standard banking operations like viewing balance, depositing money, withdrawing cash, and exiting the system — all through a console-based interaction.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies Used:
- **Programming Language:** Java
- **IDE/Editor:** Notepad++ / Any basic text editor
- **Execution:** Terminal / Command Prompt using `javac` and `java` commands

## ✨ Features:
- View current balance 💰
- Deposit money into account 💵
- Withdraw cash with validation 💳
- Clean and simple user interface in console 📟
- Loop-based menu navigation until user exits

## 🚀 How to Run:
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Compile the Java file using:
3.  Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the ATM.

## 🎯 Outcome:
This project helped me understand Java fundamentals like:
- Conditional statements (`if`, `switch`)
- Loops (`while`)
- User input handling (`Scanner`)
- Class and object structure

It gave hands-on experience with how real-world applications like banking systems handle basic operations.
